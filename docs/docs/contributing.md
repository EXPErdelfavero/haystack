# Contributing to Haystack

### Bugs

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack-ui/issues) for our bug reporting. Please make sure the bug isn't already listed before opening a new issue.

### Development

All work on Haystack happens directly on Github. Core Haystack team members will review opened pull requests.

### Requests

If you see a feature that you would like to be added, please open an issue in the respective repository or in the general [Haystack](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/issues) repo.

### Contributing in Documentation

For contributing in documentation, you can use `Edit this page` button on any page in [https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack), or directly modify the corresponding .md files in https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/docs. Once you update docs and your PR is merged in the changes are automatically deployed to  [https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack) through a travis job pipeline.
 
The documentation site on  [https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack) is based on [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) organizational framework. The documentation source can be found on the gh-pages branch in the [base haystack repository](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack/).
